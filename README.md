Insights Subteam

**Team Leads:** [Linnea May](https://github.com/linnealovespie) (CS '21) and [Max Chen](https://github.com/maxlchen) (CS '21)  
**Advisor:** [Prof. Jeff Rzeszotarski](https://jeffrz.com/)

## About Us
The Insighs team is one of the three subteams in [Cornell Data Science](cornelldata.science), a student led undergraduate project team at Cornell University. Our goal is to provide insight into complex systems through a combination of data science and visual interfaces. Our work is interdisciplinary and unique - our projects range from visualizing neural network training to applying natural language processing and deep learning towards detecting fake news.

## Current Projects
