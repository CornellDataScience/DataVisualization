## About Us
The Insighs team is one of the three subteams in [Cornell Data Science](cornelldata.science), a student led undergraduate project team at Cornell University. We are a  new team of data scientists and designers dedicated to main goals: 
1. Gaining knowledge of complex situations using a variety of data science methods, from Natural Language Processing to Deep Learning. 
2. Creating visual interfaces that display the knowledge to an audience, and researching the best ways of doing so. 

## This Semester
For our first semester we are working on building up the team and our projects, with a strong focus on visualizing how different algorithms in the field of data science function.
